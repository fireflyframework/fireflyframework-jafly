/**
 * Core document entity representing a document in the Firefly ECM system.
 *
 * <p>This immutable domain entity encapsulates all essential information about a document,
 * including its metadata, content properties, security attributes, and lifecycle information.
 * The class follows Firefly's architectural standards by using UUIDs for entity identifiers
 * and Long values for user/owner references.</p>
 *
 * <p>Key features:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Immutable design using Lombok's {@code @Data} and {@code @Builder}</li>
 *   <li>JSON serialization support via {@code @Jacksonized}</li>
 *   <li>Comprehensive metadata and audit trail support</li>
 *   <li>Security and compliance features (encryption, legal hold, retention)</li>
 *   <li>Flexible tagging and categorization system</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Example usage:</p>
 * <pre>
 * Document document = Document.builder()
 *     .id(UUID.randomUUID())
 *     .name("contract.pdf")
 *     .mimeType("application/pdf")
 *     .size(1024L)
 *     .status(DocumentStatus.ACTIVE)
 *     .ownerId(UUID.randomUUID())
 *     .createdAt(Instant.now())
 *     .build();
 * </pre>
