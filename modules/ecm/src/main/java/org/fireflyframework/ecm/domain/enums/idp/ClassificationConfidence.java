/**
 * Classification confidence enumeration for Intelligent Document Processing (IDP) operations.
 * 
 * <p>This enumeration defines confidence levels for document classification results.
 * It provides a standardized way to express how certain the IDP system is about
 * its classification decisions, helping users understand the reliability of results.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Confidence levels are typically mapped to numerical ranges:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><strong>VERY_HIGH:</strong> 95-100% confidence</li>
 *   <li><strong>HIGH:</strong> 85-94% confidence</li>
 *   <li><strong>MEDIUM:</strong> 70-84% confidence</li>
 *   <li><strong>LOW:</strong> 50-69% confidence</li>
 *   <li><strong>VERY_LOW:</strong> Below 50% confidence</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>These confidence levels help determine whether results should be:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Automatically accepted (VERY_HIGH, HIGH)</li>
 *   <li>Flagged for review (MEDIUM)</li>
 *   <li>Rejected or require manual processing (LOW, VERY_LOW)</li>
 * </ul>
