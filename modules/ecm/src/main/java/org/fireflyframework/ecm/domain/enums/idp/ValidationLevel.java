 * Validation level enumeration for Intelligent Document Processing (IDP) operations.
 * 
 * <p>This enumeration defines the different levels of validation that can be
 * applied to documents and extracted data during IDP processing. Each level
 * represents a different depth and rigor of validation checks.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Validation levels are organized by increasing thoroughness:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><strong>BASIC:</strong> Simple format and structure checks</li>
 *   <li><strong>STANDARD:</strong> Business rule validation and cross-field checks</li>
 *   <li><strong>COMPREHENSIVE:</strong> Advanced validation with external data sources</li>
 *   <li><strong>STRICT:</strong> Maximum validation with regulatory compliance</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>Higher validation levels provide greater accuracy but may require more
 * processing time and resources. The appropriate level depends on the use case,
 * compliance requirements, and acceptable risk tolerance.</p>
