 * Unified interface for publishing events to different messaging systems.
 * <p>
 * This interface provides a reactive API for publishing events to various messaging platforms
 * including Kafka, RabbitMQ, and in-memory Spring Events.
 * <p>
 * The interface is designed to be:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Reactive - Returns Mono&lt;Void&gt; for non-blocking operations</li>
 *   <li>Flexible - Supports multiple messaging platforms through abstractions</li>
 *   <li>Extensible - Allows custom serializers and metadata</li>
 *   <li>Resilient - Integrates with circuit breakers and retry mechanisms</li>
 *   <li>Observable - Provides hooks for metrics and monitoring</li>
 * </ul>
